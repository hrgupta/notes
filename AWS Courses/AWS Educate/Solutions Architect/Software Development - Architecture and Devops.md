# Solutions Architect

A Solutions/Cloud Architect is an IT professional who is responsible for overseeing a company's cloud computing strategy.

In this Pathway, you will explore:

* Different scripting languages necessary for this role, including Python, Javascript, and using the command line interface.
* Software development architecture, and efficient DevOps strategies
* Data related topics including data management, migration, structures, warehouse/lakes, as well as relational and non-relational databases.
* Various platform technologies, including Windows and Linux, and virtualization.
* Networking topics, including architecture, protocols, virtual private clouds, provisioning, directory service, and troubleshooting tips.

## Software Development: Introduction

Software development is a process by which standalone or individual software is created using a specific programming language. It involves writing a series of interrelated programming code, which provides the functionality of the developed software. Software development may also be called application development and software design.

Below are some of the definitions of Software Architecture.

**Partitioning** is a key part here for a number of reasons.

**BUY** vs **BUILD** decision? is a pretty commom issue we have to deal with as a solution architect.

* Good things are well architectured
* Good Architecture is hard

## Software Development: DevOps

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.

### DevOps Practices

One fundamental practice is to perform very frequent but small updates. This is how organizations innovate faster for their customers.

Although the cadence and size of updates will vary, organizations using a DevOps model deploy updates much more often than organizations using traditional software development practices.

The following are DevOps best practices: 

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Microservices
* Infrastructure as Code
* Monitoring and Logging
* Communication and Collaboration

**Continuous Integration**

Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository,after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

**Continuous Delivery**

Continuous delivery is a DevOps software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.

**Microservices**

The microservices architecture is a design approach to build a single application as a set of small services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface using a lightweight mechanism, typically an HTTP-based application programming interface (API).

**Infrastructure as Code**

Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration.

**Monitoring and Logging**

Organizations monitor metrics and logs to see how application and infrastructure performance impacts the experience of their product’s end user. By capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users, shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes.

**Communication and Collaboration**

Increased communication and collaboration in an organization is one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps. The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations

## Software Development: DevOps Blue/Green

A **blue/green** deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software code. **Blue/green** deployments, which may also be referred to as A/B deployments require two identical hardware environments that are configured exactly the same way. While one environment is active and serving end users, the other environment remains idle.

**Blue/green** deployments are often used for consumer-facing applications and applications with critical uptime requirements. New code is released to the inactive environment, where it is thoroughly tested. Once the code has been vetted, the team makes the idle environment active, typically by adjusting a router configuration to redirect application program traffic. The process reverses when the next software iteration is ready for release.

If problems are discovered after the switch, traffic can be directed back to the idle configuration that still runs the original version. Once the new code has proven itself in production, the team may choose to update code in the idle configuration environment to provide an added measure of capability for disaster recovery.

An example AWS blue/green deployment is shown below:

## Software Development: Infrastructure as Code

As your teams and infrastructure grow, it becomes more difficult to track IT resource changes as well as identify who made changes and when. It also becomes harder to enforce standards for your infrastructure resources, resulting in configuration drift and potential security issues. On AWS, you can easily standardize infrastructure configurations for commonly used IT services while also enabling self-service provisioning for your company. Once these resources are provisioned, you can then track how these resources are connected and monitor configuration changes and drift.

The below product service matrix shows information about AWS Infrastructure resources.

Categories of Tools     |       Service     |       Description
------------------------|-------------------|--------------------
Provisioning            | AWS CloudFormation| AWS CloudFormation is a service that provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.
Operations Management   |AWS Systems Manager AWS CloudTrail AWS Config | AWS provides a set of services for systems and operations management that allows you to control your infrastructure resources with proper governance and compliance.
