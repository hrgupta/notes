# Software Development - Programming and Scripting 

## Programming - C, C++, C#

C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s. Ranked among the most widely used languages, C has a compiler for most computer systems and has influenced many popular languages – notably C++.

C# is a general object-oriented programming (OOP) language for networking and Web development. C# is specified as a common language infrastructure (CLI) language. In January 1999, Dutch software engineer Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to develop C# as a complement to Microsoft’s NET framework. Initially, C# was developed as C-Like Object Oriented Language (Cool). The actual name was changed to avert potential trademark issues. In January 2000, NET was released as C#. Its NET framework promotes multiple Web technologies.

C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language. C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.

## Programming - .NET

Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is a Microsoft object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It evolved from Visual Basic 6 (VB6) to meet an increasing need for easy web-services and web development.  VB.Net was designed to take advantage of the .NET framework-based classes and run-time environment. It was re-engineered by Microsoft as part of its .NET product group.VB.NET supports abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Programming - Java

Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages. Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems.

## Programming - Python

Python is a multiparadigm, general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language. Python allows programmers to use different programming styles to create simple or complex programs, get quicker results and write code almost as if speaking in a human language. Some of the popular systems and applications that have employed Python during development include Google Search, YouTube, BitTorrent, Google App Engine, Eve Online, Maya and iRobot machines.

## Scripting - CLI

Command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way. CLI is quite different from the graphical user interface (GUI) that is presently being used in the latest operating systems.

## Scripting - Javascript

Javascript (Links to an external site.) (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user’s browser, etc.

## Scripting - PHP

PHP is a recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, a scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive HTML Web pages. A server processes PHP commands when a website visitor opens a page, then sends results to the visitor’s browser.

## Scripting - Powershell

PowerShell (Links to an external site.) is an automated task framework from Microsoft, with a command line shell and a scripting language integrated into the .NET framework, which can be embedded within other applications. It automates batch processing and creates system management tools. It includes more than 130 standard command line tools for functions and enables administrators to perform tasks on local and remote Windows systems through access to Component Object Model (COM) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).  

## Scripting - Ruby

Ruby is an open source, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. Designed to provide a programming language that focuses on simplicity and productivity, the creation of Ruby drew its inspiration from Lisp, Smalltalk and Perl. Although naturally object-oriented, Ruby can also be applied using procedural and functional programming styles.
