# Network

## Introduction

A computer network is a group of computer systems and other computing hardware devices that are linked together through communication channels to facilitate communication and resource-sharing among a wide range of users. Networks are commonly categorized based on their characteristics.

## Architecture

Network Architecture is the complete framework of an organization's computer network. The diagram of the network architecture provides a full picture of the established network with detailed view of all the resources accessible. It includes hardware components used for communication, cabling and device types, network layout and topologies, physical and wireless connections, implemented areas and future plans. In addition, the software rules and protocols also constitute to the network architecture. This architecture is always designed by a network manager/administrator with coordination of network engineers and other design engineers.

Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile device), back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud). To briefly summarize: the front-end is the part you see, and the back-end is the computing that happens behind the scenes.

Cloud services can be delivered publicly or privately using the internet and can also remain within a company’s network when delivered over an intranet. Sometimes, organizations make use of a combination of both. 

No matter where the actual “cloud” is—a company’s own data center or a service provider’s data center, cloud computing uses networking to enable convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources like networks, storage, servers, services, and applications. By using virtualization, these assets can be provisioned and released quickly and easily as necessary.

Because of technology like virtualization and hypervisors, it’s possible for many virtual servers to exist on a single physical server. These technologies power other cloud subscriptions like Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and more.

FRONT END PLATFORM | BACK END PLATFORM | CLOUD BASED DELIVERY
-------------------|-------------------|-------------------
Front-end is the side that is visible to the client, customer, or user. Front-end pieces include the user interface, and the client’s computer system or network that is used for accessing the cloud system. | The back-end pieces are on the side used by the service provider. These include various servers, computers, data storage systems, virtual machines, and programs that together constitute the cloud of computing services. The back-end side also is responsible for providing security mechanisms, traffic control and protocols that connect networked computers for communication. | Cloud computing services are everywhere these days. For example, if you use QuickBooks for your accounting, or Expedia to schedule your travel, or Netflix to watch you favorite series, you’re a cloud computing user. These are all examples of subscriptions a company or individual can purchase that enable them to use the software, typically known as Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS.

## Provisioning

Provisioning is the enterprise-wide configuration, deployment and management of multiple types of IT system resources. An organization's IT or HR department oversees the provisioning process, which is applied to monitor user and customer access rights and privacy while ensuring enterprise resource security.

## Directory Services

Directory services are software systems that store, organize and provide access to directory information in order to unify network resources. Directory services map the network names of network resources to network addresses and define a naming structure for networks.

The directory service provides transparency to protocols and network topology, permitting users to access resources without having to be aware of the physical location of the devices. It’s an important component of the network operating system and is a central information repository for a service delivery platform.
